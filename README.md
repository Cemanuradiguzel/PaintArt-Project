# PaintArt-Project
This repository contains the source code for the PaintArt Project, a drawing application developed using OpenCV and C++.
The project allows users to draw geometric shapes, such as lines, triangles, rectangles, and circles, as well as dynamically 
adjust colors, brush size, and eraser size via trackbars. It also integrates real-time image processing features such as 
blurring, edge detection, and webcam control.
